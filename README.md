# React Blog - Redux Hooks

![License badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green)

## Description

For this project, I updated the client-side of my [React Blog](https://github.com/sg0703/React_Blog) app.

React Blog is a full stack MERN application. I rewrote the frontend using Redux Hooks, utilized a new library for Google Sign-In, and updated styling with Bootstrap. This app uses a custom backend (REST API) that I built using Node and Express. The API has protected routes that use Google's Sign In API to verify tokens before allowing access. The backend manages a MongoDB Atlas database.

The frontend is hosted on my personal domain. The backend is hosted on Heroku and for the database I used MongoDB Atlas.

The app is deployed on my personal domain. Check it out [here](https://samgates.io/projects/react-blog-hooks/)!
